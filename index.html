      <p>Maria was fascinated by fat, black cat.</p>
      <p>It was sitting high on the tree and making so terryfing sound that nobody could pass him without the glance. She noticed three things though:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>People looked disgusted by him.</li>
      <li>They wanted to get away as fast as possible.</li> 
      <li>Nobody thought about helping him out.</li> 
      </ol>
      <p>Only she did. The problem was that nobody cared about her neither.</p>
      <p>Her spirits drooped for good when she read in <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/">Daily News</a> the most horrible news that could came up today.</p>
